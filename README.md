## Commands

nvm provides several commands to manage Node.js versions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most common commands:

- `nvm use <version>`: Activates the specified version for the current session.
- `nvm ls`: Lists all installed Node.js versions.
- `nvm uninstall <version>`: Removes the specified version from your system.
- `nvm alias <name> <version>`: Creates an alias for a specific version.

## Configuration

You can configure nvm to suit your needs. Here are some common configurations:
